The majority of this repository is Reloaded II's mod template.

The two images used in the Preview and GameBanana use sprites ripped from the game.

The images in the textures folder are also ripped from the game.

The font is by Mozilla and is under the SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 license: http://mozilla.github.io/Fira/

The ImGui library is under the MIT license: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

All other libraries used are by Sewer56 under LGPL-3.0 and maybe GPL for the Interface library... but that seems weird to me.

Anything that differs from the template should be made by me.
Anything made by me is under the WTFPL-69.420 license, except, this line in particular that you are reading is proprietary just out of spite. I'm angry, I just really hate doing this shit.
